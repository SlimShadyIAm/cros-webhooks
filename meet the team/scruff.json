      "description": "Hi all, I'm Scruff, 32 and The English Mod.  I have a Lenovo 500e which i use for my day to day work needs, I got this model for it's battery life/Android Apps/Crostini.  Being a Linux user for over 15 years, this made it a very smooth transition.\n\nIn my day to day job I am a Publican, so if we are chatting and I go silent, it's more than likely work.\n\nFeel free to @ me if you need me, I wll get back to you as soon as possible.",
