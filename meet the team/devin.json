I don’t really play games that much anymore, but when I do, it’s just Minecraft.\n\nI like to mess around with breaking software and setting arduino LEDs on fire in my free time, and try to have a social life in school and online. I do not like getting pinged or being made fun of for who I am though, so please try to avoid that :)\n\nThe Chromebook I currently own is a Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 m3 model",
