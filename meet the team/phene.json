Since then, I've been exploring the platform, building bots and servers of my own, and moderating groups like this one.\n\nI've been hooked on Chrome OS since 2019, when I received my first device. Since then, I've started a collection of 3 devices, and have gotten my family on the Chromebook train.\n\nIn my free time, you'll often see me playing a game, or hanging out in the server. I'm happy to be here, and I'm hoping I'll be here for a long time.",
