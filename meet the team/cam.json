I joined the r/ChromeOS Discord Server once I found out in April 2018.\n\nI've never actually purchased a Chromebook before - all of my Chrome OS devices are provided to me by my high school, two Chromebooks and one Chromebox. I've loved their simplicity and use them as my daily driver.\n\nI've also been working hard on Google's Chromebook Help Community - earning over 250+ answers to other people's issues and making many posts within my time there since December 2017.\n\nI'm a competitive gamer as well as a very small content creator - I will play a variety of games in my free time, or stream / upload to my YouTube channel. If you're looking for an extra teammate, I'll be happy to join if I'm available! :D"
