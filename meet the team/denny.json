I'm also a moderator in the r/Crostini and r/crouton subreddits and a Google PE (Product Expert) in the Chromebook, Pixelbook and Pixel Slate help forums. Oh, I'm not a gamer so don't hold that against me.\n\nI'm a retired tech guy that just can't give up tech. I was a Cr-48 Test Pilot back in 2010 when they were giving them away. I got hooked on Chrome OS back then and haven't stopped. I now have a small collection of Chromebooks and it keeps growing.\n\nIn my free time, oh wait, it's all free time, I read fiction, enjoy travelling, especially cruising and yes, spending a lot of time on my Chromebook helping out when I can and just generally learning all I can about all of this stuff."
