      "description": "Hey, I'm Jess and I'm just your average busy college student that likes to tinker.\nI joined Discord in March 2017 because my friend and I decided skype was stupid and we needed a different platform to talk on. As I said above, I like to tinker and I am also a robotics and tech enthusiast. Unfortunately I end up breaking everything around me whether it's software or hardware.\nI became a part of the Google Product Forums in 2016 and still try to help there as well as here on this Discord server when I get the chance. I love helping people with a passion, which is why I'm here! I'm also a moderator on r/ChromeOS.\nIn my freetime (If I get any) I like drawing, looking at Roombas to adopt, and playing various mobile games.",
