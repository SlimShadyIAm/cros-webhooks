I've been using Discord for a while, to keep up with gaming and tech trends, chat with friends from older jobs and keep up with my two boys.  I am a huge Google fan, jumped right into the entire Google ecosystem from day one.  Gmail early adopter, Nexus One early adopter, ChromeOS early adopter and Crostini early adopter.  I am deep into security and the infosec community, I've worked on several AAA game titles and love gaming with my kids.  I love to woodwork, write code (mostly golang) and annoy my wife with my awesome humor.  I'm also a transplant to the US from Australia."
