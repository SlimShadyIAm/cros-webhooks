      "description": "Howdy, I'm Aamir! Iâ€™m a 23 year old graduate student studying computer science and engineering in Denmark.  I originally founded this server way back in (2017?) when I got my first Chromebook because there was no Discord server for it, and later it became affiliated with the subreddit as well. Eventually I had to get a different laptop for university and wanted to focus on other things, so I handed the server off to nt4cats and here we are today.\n\nIn my free time I do absolutely nothing except play Overwatch and stare at my phone. Sometimes I like to go bouldering.",
