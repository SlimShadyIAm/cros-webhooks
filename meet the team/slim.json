I'm Aamir; I'm 19 years old and I'm a first year computer science student.\n\nI've been an avid Discord user since October of 2015; I initially joined to use Discord use as a Skype replacement to talk to my friends while playing games, like many have in the past. Since then I've become infatuated with it, becoming active in large servers such as r/PCMasterRace's Discord server, my university's gaming group, and other large subreddit communities.\n\nI bought my first Chromebook in 2016 and immediately fell in love with it, and in December of 2016 I had the idea to create a Discord community for it, as there was no such community at the time. It quickly got picked up as the official r/chromeos server, and I can only attribute this success to you guys, the community.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy grinding away at Overwatch, hanging out with friends and watching Netflix."
