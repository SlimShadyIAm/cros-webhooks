      "description": "Hi, I'm Ryan! I'm 16 years old and I'm passionate about technology and helping others. I'm just an average student, tinkerer and robotics nerd.\n\nI joined Discord roughly two years ago, but I never really got heavily invested in it until early 2020, when myself and a group of friends I had made over the last couple of years online decided to migrate.\n\nI've been involved in the r/ChromeOS subreddit for over 2 years and I was delighted to gain more moderation experience under my belt by joining the moderation teams for both the subreddit and subsequently this server.\n\nI purchased my first Chromebook in 2017 after having used one on and off whenever I needed to be away from my desktop. I fell in love immediately and I haven't looked back since. I love the simplicity and ease of user experience. My current daily driver is a HP Chromebook x360 14c.\n\nI enjoy helping others as well as making new friends in big and small communities alike. I also moderate r/ChromeOS, r/AndroidTV, r/drones and r/Logitech on reddit, alongside a number of smaller subreddits and Formula 1 communities.\n\nAlways feel free to ping me if I'm needed - I'll be around whenever I get a chance.\n\nIn my free time I can normally be found out around our farm cuddling with our sheep, or (trying) to update the r/ChromeOS wiki.
