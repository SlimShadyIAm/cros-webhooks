My IRL name is John-Curtis, or JC for short.\nI joined Discord a few years back to get rid of Skype.\nWhat got me into chromebooks was the simplicity of the operating system and the all wonderful battery life. My first chromebook was the HP Chromebook 14 G5, or Falco for those of you keeping count with the intent of using it strictly for reporting at a prior job. The promise of better productivity using web apps led me to lurk on r/ChromeOS then more recently here at the Discord channel. After heavily relying on Chromebooks and eventually turning most folks to Chromebooks at my old job, I eventually was recognized for doing so. I was offered a position representing Chromebooks in retail spaces local to where I am.\nWhen Iâ€™m active, you can say I am your residential sales person.\nGoogle squee boii - Pixel person - Secretly wants to be a meme - coffee is life, coffee is love"
