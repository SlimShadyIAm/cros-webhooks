      "description": "Hello, I'm Perry and I'm an old man who works as a Systems Engineer for a high end home A/V and home automation integrator out of the Boston MA area.  I work from my home office full time.\n\nI'm a major proponent of ChromeOS in business and have worked with several companies to convert them to ChromeOS from traditional desktop/laptop environments.  I joined the ChromeOS server sometime late in 2018 or early 2019.  Since then I've been trying to be somewhat helpful to people with a focus on Chrome for business, and some hobbyists as well.\n\nMy personal Chrome devices include a Pixel Slate and Pixelbook Go.",
