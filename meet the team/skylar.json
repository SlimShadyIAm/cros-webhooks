I got into Chrome OS as I migrated away from Apple products (A change I've largely reverted since) but still have a passion for the OS and devices running it.\n\nI'm the maintainer of cros.tech, the best place to track Chrome OS Updates, so if you have any suggestions or encounter issues, let me know. I currently use a Google Pixelbook, and a Lenovo Thinkpad running Chrome OS Flex.\n\nI spend my time playing VALORANT, Animal Crossing, and Beat Saber, and hanging out with my dog, Panda.",
