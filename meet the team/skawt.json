      "description": "I'm Scott and I'm a semi-retired network consultant and business owner. I'm a tech enthusiast and I'm always playing with the latest technology devices.\n\nI joined the ChromeOS Discord server in 2018 after spending several months on the r/chromeos subreddit, participating in various threads and providing support. I started using ChromeOS back with the first generation Samsung Chromebook in 2011, but lost interest in it at the time because I already had smaller, thinner laptops that did more.\n\nIn 2018 I picked up the first standalone ChromeOS tablet device, the Acer Chromebook Tab 10. At the time I was using a Pixel C Android tablet as my primary computing device, and switched to the Acer tablet because I could finally have a device that ran Android apps and had a full desktop browser with extensions. I've since switched to a Google Pixel Slate.\n\nSince I joined the ChromeOS Discord, I've been providing technical assistance and being a general nuisance to everyone.",
