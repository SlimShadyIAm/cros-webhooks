This server is run and staffed by volunteers.  We have families, jobs, and even have other hobbies.  Also, we live literally around the world, but don't have 24x7 coverage -- we do sleep.  Don't doubt that this server exists because the people here like helping people with problems, but we cannot always provide immediate help.  If you're in a hurry use the $helpers command to ping our volunteers, and then please be patient and someone will respond when we can.\n\nPlease use this 15-minute timeout to relax and find your peaceful place.  You'll be removed from timeout automatically when your 15 minutes is over."
